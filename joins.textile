A two table join :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
class Playlist(var id: Long, var name: String, var path: String) extends KeyedEntity[Long] {
 
  import MusicDb._
 
  // a two table join :
  def songsInPlaylistOrder =
    from(playlistElements, songs)((ple, s) =>
      where(ple.playlistId === id and ple.songId === s.id)
      select(s)
      orderBy(ple.songNumber asc)
    )
}
]]></script>

The select clause can return anything that is in the scope, for example it
could return both joined objects with : select((s, ple))
