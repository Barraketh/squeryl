h2. Features 

* A DSL for manipulating database objects with SQL like expressions. Supported SQL constructs are : <br/>
Select, Update, Insert, Delete, SubQueries, Left Right and Full Outer Join, <br/>
Standard aggregate functions, Group By, Distinct, ForUpdate.

* SQL Schema generation based on class definitions

* Transparent management of auto incremented keys

* Type safety making SQL's conversion rules enforceable at compile time

* Dynamic queries

* Query Pagination


h2. Features Not yet implemented

* A compiler plugin that provides a greater level of validation <br/><br/>
Right now there are still ways that one can write an invalid query, 
i.e. one for which the database will complain at runtime.
For one can call an aggregate function within a group by clause without 
the compiler preventing it.<br/><br/>
I have experimented with ways of enforcing this using the type system,
but it adds complexity not only to the implementation but to the the DSL. <br/><br/>
A plugin could also give more explanatory (SQL specific) messages than the 
ones given by the type system. <br/><br/>
At the moment my only reluctance for such a plugin is the required 
configuration that is required by user code (breaking the minimalism), 
for this reason, the plugin should limit itself to validation.

* Batched updates

* Support for mapping inheritance in the database other than the _map each concrete class to a table_ approach

* Schema evolution (other than dropping the whole database and recreating it)

* Optimistic Concurrency Control

Proposals for new features can be discussed on the "discussion group":http://groups.google.com/group/squeryl
