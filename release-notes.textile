h3. 0.9.4-RC2

*   Fix for issue 48 (Exception thrown in outer join with subquery member)
    the problem was that the ordering of the table expression was not strict, so the from expression
    would get mixed with a join expression.
*   test case for outer join with group by
*   Support for overriding default database column type declaration
*   Fix for issue 45 (Timestamp as query input param gets truncated)
*   @transient applied to PersistenceStatus._isPersisted
*   Fix for issue 16 : SQL 'in' operator now accepts empty lists and inhibits
    "not in (empty)" tautology and returns an always false for "in (empty)"
