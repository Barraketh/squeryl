<div class='span-12'>
h3. Write compiler validated statements

Squeryl statements that pass compilation won't fail at runtime. Refactor your schema as often as is required, the Scala compiler and your IDE will tell you exactly which lines of code are affected.
</div>

<div class='span-12 last'>
h3. Never repeat yourself

The Composability of Squeryl statements allows you to define them *only once* and *reuse* them within other queries.
</div>

<div class='span-12'>
h3. Write declaratively

Write as declaratively as Sql, only with less boilerplate. Sql's declarativeness is _*preserved*_, not encapsulated in a lower level API that requires imperative and procedural code to get things done.
</div>

<div class='span-12 last'>
h3. Control the granularity of database fetches

The composability of statements along with lazy evaluation allows defining precisely the optimal level of granularity of database fetches to minimize database roundtrips.
</div>
