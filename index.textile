h4. Squeryl is a strongly typed DSL (domain specific language) for SQL databases in which table rows are manipulated as Scala objects via an SQL like language.

h4. It does not try to hide relational database concepts from the developer, on the contrary it exposes them as first class citizens so they can be leveraged from within the Scala language.

h3. Motivation

* _*Static validation of database code*_ : 
If your Squeryl statements compile, chances are pretty good that they won't fail at runtime.

* _*Minimalism*_ :
When complexity in an application exceeds a certain treshold, it's evolution and maintenance become an increasingly difficult, costly, and unpleasant burden.
A persistence layer addresses only one aspect among many in an application and should leave as much _conceptual room_ as possible for the other aspects.

* _*Reuse*_ : 
Squeryl expressions are composable just like their Sql counterpart. A given query can be defined 
once (and only once) and reused within other queries, can help to write DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) code.


h3. Squeryl is not 

* A Database abstraction layer

* A Fa√ßade that tries to make a relational database look like an OO database
