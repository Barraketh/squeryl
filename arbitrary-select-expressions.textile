h2. The <u>&</u> function 

The expression within 

The select clause will take any closure in parameter and evaluate it on the client side (client side as opposed to database side) Sometimes it is usefull to have expressions evaluated on the database side, this is what the *&* function does.

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
  	
  	// the * is done on the client side :
  	 
    from(artists)(a => 
      select(a.id * 1000)
	)  	

    // in this case it is computed by the database :
    	
    from(artists)(a => 
      select(&(a.id * 1000))
	)  	
]]></script>

A select can have more than one invocation of & :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
  	
  val t2:Tuple2[Double, String] =  
    from(artists)(a => 
      select((&(a.id * 1000), &(a.firstName || a.lastName)))
	)  	
]]></script>
