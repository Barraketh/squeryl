h2. Which version ?


Gien that Squeryl is in it's infancy and that fixes are added frequently, the _nightly_ release is the preffered version :

"squeryl_2.8.0.Beta1-RC8-0.9.1_latest-head.jar":http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/downloads/squeryl_2.8.0.Beta1-RC8-0.9.1_latest-head.jar

The release process should become more formalized as Squeryl progresses towards maturity
