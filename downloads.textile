h2. Which version ?


Gien that Squeryl is in it's infancy right now and that fixes are added frequently, the _nightly_ release is the preffered version :

"squeryl_2.8.0.Beta1-RC8-0.9.1_latest-head.jar":http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/downloads/squeryl_2.8.0.Beta1-RC8-0.9.1_latest-head.jar


That is the one with that ends with _latest-head.jar
	
The release process should become formalized as Squeryl progresses towards maturity
