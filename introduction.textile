JPA, JDO, Hybernate ORMs make ones life much easyer than dealing with raw JDBC, and writing database applications
is certainly more pleasant than it was a decade ago, but the current generation of ORMs still leave room for 
improvement. Current Java ORMs are probably the best that can be written in the Java language.

h2. String and annotations based queries inhibits reusability by not being composable 

h2. SQL is a high level declarative language, JPA/JDO is lower level and requires imperative 
current generation ORMs encapsulate them as lo

Optimizing the granularity of fetches is key step of performance tuning.
