h2. It just works ! 

A key goal in the design of Scala was interoperability with Java, and Martin Odersky succeeded amazingly well in this regard.  
 
One a build is setup for compiling Java and Scala sources, the rest is very straight forward.

# Setup a build 

# Define the Schema in scala, persistant classes should use @BeanInfo annotations, this will cause the compuler to generate setters and getters for every property 

# Define DAO (query wrappers) in scala


h3. That's it !
