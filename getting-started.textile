h3. The recommended version is 0.9.4-RC7

Supported Scala versions are Scala2.9.0, Scala2.8.1 and Scala2.8.0

h2. SBT

After having setup your project to use SBT (see "how to setup SBT":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup)
Declare the Squeryl dependency in the SBT project definiition

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
import sbt._

class YourProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultProject(info) {
	
  val squeryl = "org.squeryl" %% "squeryl" % "0.9.4-RC7"
   
  //In this example, we declare a dependency on all common databases, 
  //in real life, there will likely be only one needed
  val posgresDriver = "postgresql" % "postgresql" % "8.4-701.jdbc4"
  val h2 = "com.h2database" % "h2" % "1.2.127"
  val mysqlDriver = "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.10"
  val posgresDriver = "postgresql" % "postgresql" % "8.4-701.jdbc4"
  val msSqlDriver = "net.sourceforge.jtds" % "jtds" % "1.2.4"
  val derbyDriver = "org.apache.derby" % "derby" % "10.7.1.1"
}
]]></script>
   
_*Note*_ : _The Oracle driver is not available via SBT/Maven, you will have to downloaded manually._

The remaining steps are :

# "Bootstrap the session factory":http://squeryl.org/sessions-and-tx.html
# "Define, and initialise a schema":http://squeryl.org/schema-definition.html

You should now be ready to insert, update, delete data, and of course run queries.

h3. Maven

If for some reason you can't use SBT and must use Maven, you will find the Squeryl artifacts hosted "here":http://nexus.scala-tools.org/content/repositories/releases/org/squeryl/
 
* groupId : *org.squeryl*
* artifactId: *squeryl_2.9.0*
* version *0.9.4-RC7*

h3. Manual dependency management

If you want to manage your dependencies without SBT or Maven, you will need the following jars :

* The Scala runtime jar, version 2.9.0 (2.8.1, or 2.8.0)
* The Squeryl jar found "here":http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/downloads
* The CGLIB cglib-nodep-2.2.jar, found "here":http://sourceforge.net/projects/cglib/files/
* A JDBC driver for your database, see "supported databases":./supported-databases.html
