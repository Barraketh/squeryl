h2. Nullity in Squeryl

The Squeryl counterpart to Null Sql values or column types is *Option[]*

Squeryl supports Scala primitive types (all AnyVal), java.util.Date and String.

Numeric types (Byte, Int, Long, Float, Double) have a default mapping
to the sql type that matches or exceed the bit length of the Scala/Java
representation.

String fields map by default to varchar(128), this can be overriden
by the length property of the *org.squeryl.Column* annotation.


Custom types for wrapping Jdbc types via *org.squeryl.CustomType* are also supported.

+Mixing primitive types and custom types in a same class or same query 
is probably not a good idea+, it should work in theory but is untested.
